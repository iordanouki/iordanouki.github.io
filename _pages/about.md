I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">The University of Manchester</a> under the supervision of
<a href="http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/people/mlujan/">Prof. Mikel Luj√°n</a> within the <a href="http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/"> Advanced Processor Technologies Research Group (APT)</a>.

My current research focuses on the interaction of specialised compute kernels with processors in modern systems and their overall impact on the system performance. I am interested in exploring and understanding the design process of hardware kernels for domain-specific applications that can co-exist efficiently with processors in a heterogeneous system. I develop the necessary tools and methodologies to simulate such systems from architectural and microarchitectural perspectives. My work is funded by <a href="https://www.arm.com/ "> Arm </a> and <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/"> EPSRC </a>.

I have previously interned at <a href="https://www.arm.com/resources/research"> Arm Research </a> in Cambridge, where I focused on exploiting parallelism at loop-level, mainly by studying the effects of various parallelisation strategies, constraints and data dependencies across loops. Before that, I worked on processor simulators using reconfigurable hardware for <a href="https://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/PAMELA/partners/index.html "> PAMELA project </a> (The University of Manchester).

I hold a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.tuc.gr/index.php?id=5397"> Technical University of Crete </a> where I had the chance to work with <a href="https://www.ece.tuc.gr/index.php?id=4531&tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Bperson%5D=289&tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Baction%5D=person&tx_tuclabspersonnel_list%5Bcontroller%5D=List"> Prof. Apostolos Dollas </a>. I am an Angelopoulos - Clinton GIU Fellow and proud member of Angelopoulos100.

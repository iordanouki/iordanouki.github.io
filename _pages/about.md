I am a Senior ASIC Design Engineer at <a href="https://www.pragmaticsemi.com">Pragmatic Semiconductor</a>. Previously, I was a Research Associate at <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk">The University of Manchester</a>. My research focused on the interaction of specialised compute kernels with processors in modern systems and their impact on overall system performance. Before, I spent nine months at Arm Research in Cambridge. My work primarily revolved around exploring parallelism at the loop level. I conducted comprehensive studies on the effects of various parallelisation strategies, constraints, and data dependencies across loops.

During my PhD, I was focused on connecting evolutionary algorithms and hardware design for specific Machine Learning problems. Specifically, I was interested in the design of Machine Learning accelerators for classification of tabular data using evolutionary algorithms, their fabrication on flexible substrates, and implementation on ASIC and FPGAs. For more details about this work, checkout my published Article in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-024-01157-5">Nature Electronics</a>.

I hold a Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="https://www.tuc.gr/en/home">Technical University of Crete</a>, which I earned in 2017. Subsequently, I pursued and successfully completed my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Manchester in 2023. Additionally, I am proud to be an Angelopoulos - Clinton GIU Fellow and a member of Angelopoulos100.
